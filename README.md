## Create a responsive website

### How we chose our project

We had a couple of options to choose from, refresh a local store's site, create one from scratch or design one for a small community.

The project we choose was to Redisign one of our teammember's old website.

This gave us a chance to use the previous content of the site.

## Generate a proper GitHub repo

### Why we are on GitHub

We choose GitHub as our collaboration platform to make use of the pull-requests, it is also the main platform BeCode uses.

We used a MIT [LISENCE](./LISENCE.md) as it fits our needs perfectly.
